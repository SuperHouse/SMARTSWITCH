SuperHouse Home Automation SmartSwitch
=======================================

Home automation light switch that can be constructed with different
button panels, all using the same logic board. This allows the same
logic board and software to be used for either single-colour or RGB
button panels, in sizes from 1 to 4 buttons.

The switch can either operate in isolation using WiFi and local power,
or it can connect to a central light switch controller via Cat-5
cable.

It's designed to mount in a standard Australian blank wall plate,
but can also fit other types of wall plate.
